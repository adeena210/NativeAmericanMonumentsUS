          <p class = "about">
            Welcome to our project: Native American Monuments in the United States! Our website features an interactive map, where you can see where Native American monuments, memorials, and heritage sites are located in the U.S. 
            These monuments are represented by markers on the map to indicate their location. 
            You can hover over these markers to see a brief summary and image of the monument. 
            If you press on “Click here to learn more!”, you will be redirected to a new page to see more information about the monument as well as why we think it's significant, whether or not we suggest you visit, and a Google Maps link to the monument. 
            If you have any monuments you would like to see added to our website, you can press on the “Want to contribute?” tab and fill out the form there. 
            Additionally, in the “Want to contribute?” tab, you will find a link to our GitHub repository, where you can contribute to our code if you would like to.

          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p class = "about">
            This website was created by Jabili Gadde and Adeena Ahmed, computer science majors at The College of New Jersey, as our final project for our Monuments, Heritage, & Belonging class. 
            We wanted to create a project that would utilize our specific skills and knowledge in terms of our programming skills and combine those with the content we have been learning and researching about in class. 
            In our project, we aim to highlight various Native American monuments, memorials, and heritage sites and explain their significance both in the context of the past and more importantly, the present.
