    <h1>National Native American Veterans Memorial</h1>
    <p>
    Native Americans serve at a greater rate than any other ethnic group in the United States. 
    As such, the National Native American Veterans Memorial honors the military service of Native Americans. 
    It is located on the grounds of the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington D.C. 
    It opened on November 11th, 2020, which was Veteran’s Day that year.

    <p>
    The memorial features a 12-foot in diameter stainless-steel circle perched on a 20-inch high stone drum, 
    which is a design concept called Warriors’ Circle of Honor. 
    The circle that is central to the memorial is important to all Native cultures. 
    Harvey Pratt, the designer of the memorial, explains that 
    “it’s the cycle of life, it’s the cycle of the seasons, it’s the sun and the moon, 
    it’s the earth, it’s kivas, it’s tipis, dance circles”, showing the significance of the circle. 
    The design also incorporates water for sacred ceremonies, benches for gathering and reflection, 
    and four lances where veterans, family members, tribal leaders, and others can tie cloths for prayers and healing. 
    There are 13 Native American veteran songs from the Ojibwe, Menominee, Blackfeet, Ho-Chunk, Kiowa, and Lakota Nations that play throughout one’s visit.
    </p>
    
    <p>It was designed by Harvey Pratt, a veteran who served in Vietnam from 1962 to 1965 and is from the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of Oklahoma. 
    Pratt is a self-taught artist whose works frequently include themes of Native American tradition and history as well as the Cheyenne people. 
    He was recognized by the Cheyenne People as an outstanding Southern Cheyenne and was inducted as a traditional Peace Chief—the Cheyenne Nation’s highest honor.

    <h3>Why We Think It’s Significant:</h3>

    <p>
    Native Americans’ service to the U.S. military had never been acknowledged on a national level prior to the installation of this memorial. 
    This is a phenomenal step in recognizing their service, especially considering how they serve at a greater rate than any other ethnic group. 
    Furthermore, this memorial was designed by a Native American man, making it true to its roots and authentic. 
    </p>

    <p>
    A quote from Rebecca Trautmann, the National Museum of the American Indian’s curator for the memorial explains why this memorial is so important in this quote: 
    “Harvey Pratt created a space where Native people will be able to—whether in groups or individually—come into the space 
    and if they want to they can do a ceremony to remember their own service or veterans from their community or their family”.

    <h3>Why Visit?:</h3>
    <p>
    We encourage you to visit the National Native American Veterans Memorial, 
    as you can better understand Native American culture by watching Native American veterans 
    and their families perform ceremonies, bless water, tie prayer cloths, and pray. 
    It’s not always possible to watch such rituals without being inclusive, and this is a rare opportunity to do so. 
    Additionally, we encourage you to visit and honor the hundreds of thousands of Native Americans who have served and will continue to serve.
